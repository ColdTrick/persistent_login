Persistent Login
================
Default Elgg persistent login only supports one "remember me" at the time. You can't be remembered on more than one browser/computer.

This plugin provides the ability to have yourself remembered on more than one place.

Be aware that this is a first (0.1) release and is a bit experimental. It would be appreciated if you could let us know if this plugin works.

This plugin will become obsolete in Elgg 1.9 as Elgg will by default allowed multiple persistent logins.
